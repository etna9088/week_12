## 📘 Project Overview

This simulation answers the question: *"How long will the money last?"* given:
- An initial deposit of $3,360
- Monthly interest of 0.48%
- Withdrawals of $560 every even-numbered month
- A $2,100 deposit added every December

The model continues until the account balance becomes zero or negative, then plots the balance over time.

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

- Loops and conditionals in MATLAB (`while`, `mod`)
- Custom interest and deposit logic
- Time-series simulation
- Plot customization and annotations

---

## 📊 Output

- Total months until depletion
- Line plot showing account balance over time
- Text box explaining parameters directly on the graph

---

## ▶️ How to Run

Open the script `bank_simulation.m` in MATLAB and click **Run**.  
The console will display the number of months the money lasts, and a plot will visualize the account's depletion over time.
